# compiler
Following are some of the assumptions I have made :-
1.	Epsilon is represented by  '#'.
2.	Productions are of the form A=B , where 'A' is a single Non-Terminal and 'B' can be any combination of Terminals and Non- Terminals.
3.	The L.H.S. of the first production rule is the start symbol.
4.	Grammer is not left recursive.
5.	Each production of a non terminal is entered on a different line.
6.	Only Upper Case letters are Non-Terminals and everything else is a terminal.
7.	Do not use '!' or '$' as they are reserved for special purposes.
8.	All input Strings have to end with a '$'.
